# Instagram-Algorithm-Visualizer 📊🤳

Welcome to **Instagram-Algorithm-Visualizer**!  
This interactive website helps you understand and visualize how Instagram's algorithms work behind the scenes. Explore the dynamics of post reach, user engagement, explore feed, and more, all through intuitive simulations and visualizations.

---

## 🌟 Introduction

Instagram's recommendation engine is a complex system that decides which content you see, when, and why. This project demystifies that process by allowing you to visualize key algorithmic processes, helping developers, marketers, and curious users gain insights into content ranking and engagement metrics.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  See how Instagram's algorithms prioritize posts, stories, and explore feed content in real time.

- **Simulation Controls:**  
  Adjust parameters to simulate different user behaviors and content types.

- **Data Insights:**  
  View breakdowns of how engagement, recency, and relevance affect post visibility.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Built with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), making it easy to interact with algorithmic models.
